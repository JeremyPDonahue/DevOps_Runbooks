# 🧠 Concept Mastery System

This folder contains a modular, repeatable system for deeply learning and retaining technical concepts.

Each concept (e.g., OKD, VPA, Service Mesh) gets its own subfolder with structured `.md` files.

---

## 🔁 How to Use This System

1. **Pick a concept to work on**  
   Add it to your `concepts_todo.md` tracker.

2. **Run the concept generator script**
   ```bash
   ./generate_concept.sh <ConceptName>
   ```

3. **Work through the files in order:**

| Step | File                             | Purpose |
|------|----------------------------------|---------|
| 1️⃣   | `01_Scope_<Concept>.md`          | Define the concept, why it matters, and break it down into subtasks. |
| 2️⃣   | `02_HandsOn_<Concept>.md`        | Set up a test environment, log what you try, and capture results/errors. |
| 3️⃣   | `03_Explain_<Concept>.md`        | Write a clear explanation in your own words to reinforce understanding. |
| 4️⃣   | `04_Playbook_<Concept>.md`       | Turn your experience into a reusable reference guide or checklist. |
| 5️⃣   | `05_Review_<Concept>.md`         | Reflect on what you've learned, what's fuzzy, and what to revisit. |
| ✅   | `mastery_checklist.md`            | Self-assess your mastery level before marking the concept complete. |

## 📅 Daily Flow Summary

Each day, pick up where you left off in one of the concept folders:

- Start with **Scope & Frame**
- Do hands-on work
- Reflect and document
- Use the **Mastery Checklist** to decide when to move on

Repeat for the next concept.

## ✅ Goal

To internalize every concept through active learning, create reusable knowledge artifacts, and be prepared to explain or apply any concept without needing to re-learn it.
