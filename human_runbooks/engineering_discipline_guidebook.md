# ðŸ§  Engineering Discipline Guidebook

A personal guide to stay sharp, focused, and growth-oriented in day-to-day technical work.

## 1. ðŸ—ƒ Compile Non-Blocking Questions

- Maintain a running list of questions that do **not** require immediate answers.
- **Avoid** interrupting teammates or cluttering Slack/Teams with what can be resolved through async research or doc reading.
- Revisit and batch ask during 1:1s or async catch-ups.

## 2. ðŸ“Ÿ Track Your Day Like `stdout`

- Every action should produce a "log line."
- Keep a time-stamped work log (e.g. in `log.md`, Notion, or Obsidian):

## 3. ðŸ§± Diagram Thinking Process

Always work through architectural ideas in three progressive formats:

1. **Whiteboard** â€“ for loose exploration and thought dumping.
2. **Notebook + Pencil** â€“ for locking down a cleaned-up version.
3. **Digital Diagram** â€“ polished architecture rendered in Lucidchart, Excalidraw, or draw.io.

## 4. ðŸ§© Break Down Complex Merge Requests

When reviewing unfamiliar or complicated MRs, answer:

- **What does it do / change?**
- **Why is it valuable?**
- **What are the risks introduced (e.g., security, performance, maintainability)?**

Write these in your own words before approving or asking questions.

## 5. ðŸ§­ Realign When Slipping

If you're losing steam, context, or discipline â€” re-read this guide and:

- Recommit to async logging.
- Pick a small task and complete it with full attention.
- Revisit your most recent `concepts/` entries to resume structured learning.
- Refresh a flashcard set to re-ground yourself in fundamentals.

**Stay curious. Stay clear. Stay accountable.**
