# 🧠 Daily Concept Mastery System

A repeatable method to learn, retain, and apply technical concepts daily.

## 🔁 Daily Learning Cycle

### ✅ 1. Scope & Frame – *15–20 min*
- Define the concept in one sentence.
- Ask: “Why does this matter?”
- Break it down into 3–5 subtopics or subtasks.
    - Add to your `concepts_todo.md`.

---

### 📚 2. Skim to Map the Terrain – *30 min*
- Skim official docs, blog posts, or videos.
- Write down recurring terms, unknowns, and questions.
- Bookmark key links or write a quick glossary.

---

### 🧪 3. Try It (Hands-On) – *45–60 min*
- Test something basic in a sandbox environment.
- Install, configure, or trigger behavior.
- Log what you tried, what worked, and what didn’t.

---

### ✍️ 4. Write It in Your Own Words – *30 min*
- Summarize what you’ve learned so far.
- Use plain language, examples, or analogies.
- Pretend you’re explaining it to a teammate or new hire.

---

### 🔁 5. Revisit & Refine – *15–20 min*
- Re-read earlier docs or revisit skipped questions.
- Fill gaps, clarify definitions, or connect dots.
- Refactor your notes with improved context.

---

### 📘 6. Capture for Reuse – *30–60 min* (Optional but valuable)
- Write a personal "playbook," checklist, or snippet.
- Store it in your knowledge base.
- Tag and organize it for future retrieval.

---

## 🧠 Optional Weekly Review – *15–30 min, once per week*
- Review mastered concepts.
- Identify weak spots to revisit.
- Resurface any "stale" in-progress items.
